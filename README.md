# 📘 DSA in Java – 30-Day Learning Challenge

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey using **Java**. This repository documents my daily progress, learnings, and code implementations of essential DSA concepts with Java.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build strong DSA problem-solving skills using Java
- Prepare for coding interviews (product-based + service-based)
- Develop an understanding of core data structures and algorithms
- Practice consistently with a structured day-by-day plan

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- 💻 Language: Java (JDK 17+)
- 🧠 IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- 📚 Practice Platforms: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank

---

## 📅 Daily DSA Progress

> ✅ **Each day will include:**  
> - Learning one new concept  
> - Implementing code  
> - Dry run and analysis  
> - Problem-solving (2–3 problems minimum)
